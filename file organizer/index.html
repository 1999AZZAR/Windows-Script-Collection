            <p>
                This script automates the process of organizing and managing files in specified directories. It categorizes files based on their types and moves older files to an archive folder, helping you maintain a well-organized file structure with minimal manual effort.

            <p>
                File Organization Automation Script is available in two versions: a .bat script and a .ps1 script. Both scripts categorize files into different categories based on their file types and move files older than a specified threshold to an archive folder.

                <li>
                    <p><strong>File Categorization:</strong> The .bat script identifies the file type of each file based on its extension and categorizes it accordingly (e.g., images, documents, videos).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Age-Based Archiving:</strong> Files are evaluated for their age. Files older than a defined threshold (default: 45 days) are moved to an archive folder within the respective category.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Automatic Organization:</strong> The script creates destination directories for each file category in both "active" and "archive" directories. It then moves files to the appropriate category based on their file type and age.</p>

                <li>Make sure to customize the script's source and destination directories to match your specific requirements.</li>
                <li>The default file age threshold is set to 45 days. You can change it by modifying the <code>$daysThreshold</code> variable in the scripts.</li>
                <li>These scripts use the Assoc command (in the .ps1 script) to determine file types based on file extensions. Ensure that file extensions are correctly associated with their respective programs on your system for accurate categorization.</li>
